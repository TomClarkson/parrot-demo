Jack and the Beanstalk

Once upon a time there lived a poor widow and her son Jack. One day, Jack's mother told him to sell their only cow.

Jack went to the market and on the way he met a man who wanted to buy his cow. Jack asked what he would give in return for the cow.

The man answered that he would give Jack some magic beans. Jack took the magic beans and went back home.
