Tigershark and the Ink Cloud Caper
Deep beneath the waves of Splash Bay, the underwater city was in trouble.
Otto the Octopus had wrapped his eight long arms around the Glowing Pearl—the magical light that kept the whole ocean bright and warm. Without it, the little fish were scared. The seahorses shivered. The crabs huddled together in the dark.
"This pearl is MINE now!" Otto laughed, squirting black ink everywhere. "No more sunshine for anyone!"
But speeding through the deep blue water came a flash of orange and blue. It was Tigershark—the fastest car in all the seven seas! His shark-fin spoiler sliced through the waves, and his headlights cut through the darkness like sunbeams.
"Not so fast, Otto!" Tigershark called out, his engine rumbling like thunder.
Otto squirted a huge cloud of ink to hide. But Tigershark wasn't afraid. He zoomed in circles—faster and faster—spinning the water into a whirlpool that swirled all the ink away!
"My hiding spot!" Otto cried.
"Give back the pearl, Otto," said Tigershark. "Everyone needs its light."
Otto clutched the pearl tighter. But then he looked around. He saw the little fish trembling. He saw the seahorses cold and sad. And for the first time, Otto felt bad.
"I... I just wanted something shiny," Otto said quietly. "Nobody ever plays with me."
Tigershark rolled closer. "You don't need to take things to make friends, Otto. You just need to share."
Slowly, Otto let go of the Glowing Pearl. Light flooded back through Splash Bay, warm and golden. The fish cheered! The seahorses danced!
And from that day on, Otto used his eight arms to help everyone—carrying groceries for the granny fish, giving the best underwater hugs, and playing catch with seven balls at once.
Tigershark sped off into the deep with a smile, ready for his next adventure.
