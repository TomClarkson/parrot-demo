The Sleepy Bunny

Once upon a time, in a cozy burrow beneath an old oak tree, there lived a little bunny named Pip. Every evening, as the sun painted the sky in shades of orange and pink, Pip would yawn and stretch his fluffy ears.

Tonight, the moon rose big and bright, casting silver light through the window. Pip hopped to his soft bed made of clover and dandelion fluff. He snuggled down deep and closed his eyes.

The gentle breeze whispered through the leaves above, singing a lullaby just for him. One by one, the stars twinkled to life, keeping watch over all the sleeping creatures below.

Pip smiled and drifted off to dream of meadows full of flowers and warm sunny days. And there, safe in his burrow, the little bunny slept peacefully until morning.
